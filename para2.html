        <P>Idk if you know or not baby but your eyes are just mesmerizing they are like a ocean in which i can dive deep and it's a ocean in which i genuinely want to drown to death....the way you lookks at me leaves me speechlesss my brain stops working it feels like the world has stopped moving the time has stopped and i just wants to stay in the moment it feels the same as taking cocaine but the benefit of your eyes are that they doesn't takes my life away but i wanna give my life to them bcz they are so beautiful mind-blowing they are the true beauty of our universe it feels like they are as vast as the whole universe....and i love you and your eyes so much frrrr......i love you baby ❤️❤️</P>
